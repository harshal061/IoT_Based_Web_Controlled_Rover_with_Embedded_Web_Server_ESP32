#  IoT-Based Web Controlled Rover with Embedded Web Server (ESP32)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple **IoT-controlled rover** powered by **ESP32**. The rover is controlled via a **web-based interface** hosted directly on the ESP32's internal HTTP server. The setup leverages **WiFiManager** for flexible Wi-Fi network configuration and **mDNS** (`esp32.local`) for convenient, user-friendly access.

Users can control the vehicle‚Äôs movement (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop) through any device connected to the same network via a browser.

## Technologies & Tools

* **ESP32 Microcontroller**
* **Arduino IDE / ESP-IDF**
* **WiFiManager Library** (for dynamic Wi-Fi provisioning)
* **ESP32 WebServer Library** (HTTP server)
* **mDNS (esp32.local)** for DNS-like access on local network
* **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** (for the browser-based control panel)
* **DC Motor Driver (H-Bridge)** for motor control (L298N / L293D)

##  Control Interface

| Action   | HTTP Endpoint |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Forward  | `/forward`    |
| Backward | `/backward`   |
| Left     | `/left`       |
| Right    | `/right`      |
| Stop     | `/stop`       |

## ‚≠ê Future Scope

* **Command Logging:** Implement a logging system on the server to record all control commands (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop) with timestamps for future analysis and debugging.
* **Path Mapping:** Develop functionality to visualize or generate a map of the rover's movement path based on the sequence of commands from the commands received.
* **Data Storage:** Store movement logs locally (e.g., SPIFFS on ESP32) or remotely (e.g., cloud database) for historical tracking.
* **Analytics Dashboard:** Create a web-based dashboard to display past movement logs, command history, and possible path heatmaps.
